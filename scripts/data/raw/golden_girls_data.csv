character,Character: Dorothy Zbornak,"Dorothy Zbornak-Hollingsworth (née Petrillo) is one of the four main characters on the 1985 NBC sitcom The Golden Girls, and its spin-off, The Golden Palace. A sardonic, introspective, compassionate, and protective substitute teacher, Dorothy moved to Miami, Florida, after her then-husband Stanley divorced her to run off with a stewardess. Along with her mother Sophia and her friend Rose, Dorothy rented a room in the Miami home of her friend Blanche Devereaux. Dorothy often acts as den mother and voice of reason among the quartet, though at times she also acted foolishly or negatively and would need her friends and family to help ground her again.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Zbornak
character,Character: Dorothy Zbornak,"Dorothy appeared in all seven seasons of The Golden Girls, and appeared twice in the series' short-lived sequel, The Golden Palace. She was portrayed by the late veteran actress and Broadway stage actress, Beatrice Arthur.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Zbornak
character,Character: Dorothy Zbornak,"Dorothy's character tends to be a strong-minded, compassionate, witty and introspective; and oftentimes sarcastic, fierce, and intimidating. Dorothy is also very intelligent, practical, no-nonsense and a known bookworm. Arguably, Dorothy is the most grounded out of the four girls in the house. Furthermore, she is incredibly protective of those she loves and cares for and those she considers family. Dorothy often was mocked by her two housemates, Rose and Blanche, as manly, strappy, tough, and a bit odd due to her stature of 5'10"" and her deep voice. She can also be highly sarcastic and blunt, saying it for what it is as well as being rude and unreasonable at times, especially towards her less-sharp housemate, Rose.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Zbornak
character,Character: Dorothy Zbornak,"However, Dorothy is also in possession of many positive traits such as being a voice of reason to her housemates and her best friends, Rose and Blanche. Despite the ridicule, Dorothy regards the three other women to be family, comforting to them and often giving great and forward-thinking advice. She often acts as the bigger person in tough situations to straighten up Rose's and Blanche's small misfortunes and losses. Dorothy helps to ground Rose and Blanche during their difficulties, often calling out hypocrisy, cruelty, injustices, and such negative behaviors and acts from others against her best friends with her 'as-is' blunt remarks. Moreover, Dorothy also has quite some talents. In ""Journey to the Center of Attention"", she is able to upstage Blanche at the latter's favorite bar, The Rusty Anchor, by singing and thus winning the admiration of Blanche's many suitors.[1] At another point, remembering how funny Dorothy could be in high school, Dorothy attempts some stand-up comedy. In the end, Dorothy wins over her audience by poking fun at her own life and bringing such subjects up such as as menopause.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Zbornak
character,Character: Dorothy Zbornak,"Dorothy is a relatively intelligent person, but her intelligence can lead her to be rude, inconsiderate, blunt, and sometimes foolish. Many times, her over-confidence and self-sabotaging mindset alienates herself from others. In ""Dorothy's New Friend"", she befriended a local author and novelist named Barbara Thorndike, and initially ignored Rose and Blanche after they told her that Barbara insulted them to their faces. However, Barbara revealed she is willing to accept an elite club's rules of no Jewish customers. Finding this out, Dorothy realized what a bad person Barbara was and, without blinking, ordered her to leave and never return before telling her to go to hell.[2] In the Season 7 episode ""Questions and Answers"", Dorothy studied extremely hard when the girls tried out for Jeopardy!, and Sophia warned Dorothy that she may be overdoing it. During the Jeopardy game, Dorothy has much confidence and does seemingly well within the handful of rounds. However, she does not advance to the next round. When Dorothy realized she would not be earning the prize money, and she studied all for nearly nothing, she breaks down and cries. Sophia comes to her rescue and reminds Dorothy that she can get over-confident, which is one of the biggest reasons as to why Dorothy didn't have many birthday parties growing up...and never went to birthday parties growing up.[3]",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Zbornak
character,Character: Dorothy Zbornak,"In spite of her strengths, Dorothy has several phobias including hospitals and flying. She eventually managed to conquer both her fears with the help of her best friends, Rose and Blanche. In keeping with the show's practice of raising social awareness, the two-part episode ""Sick and Tired"" involved Dorothy suffering from extreme exhaustion, which was ultimately determined to be Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.[4] Dorothy was also shown to have a recurring gambling problem that eventually caused her to seek help through Gamblers Anonymous. She started smoking cigarettes again after quitting many years earlier, because of stress from her mother's remarriage in ""Sophia's Wedding, Part 1"".[5] Presumably, Dorothy was able to kick the smoking habit, as she wasn't seen with a cigarette since.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Zbornak
character,Character: Dorothy Zbornak,"While Dorothy has had a semi-active love life, her choices in men have not always been favorable. Her longest relationship was with her first husband, Stanley Zbornak, with whom she was with for a period of thirty-eight years following a shotgun wedding in their senior year of high-school. Stan repeatedly cheated on her throughout her marriage to him, including with a breakfast bar waitress, his own secretary, and finally an airline stewardess whom he left her for.

Dorothy mentioned she and Phil remained relatively close and maintained affection for one another well into their adulthood. They kept in touch possibly through phone calls.

Sophia revealed that Dorothy's IQ stands well around 173, which is massively impressive and would rank Dorothy as possessing a genius-level intellect. However, Sophia acted a tad brashly and that IQ turned out to be a lie.[10] When Dorothy was five, her father took her to get her tonsils taken out and left her at the hospital because he needed to work to pay for the operation. This caused Dorothy to develop a fear of hospitals which persisted well into her golden years.[8] She would also torment her sister Gloria with scary bedtime stories, such as ""The Boogeyman and the Little Girl"", ""The Zombie in the Hamper"", and ""Cannibal Parents"".",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Zbornak

Unknown to Dorothy, however, John had shown up and her mother had turned him away after seeing his complete lack of respect for himself and others -- showing up dressed like a ""hood"" and mouthing off to Sophia.[14] After being stood up, Dorothy went to the prom with Stanley Zbornak because she felt as if she could not do any better. Dorothy had too much to drink at the senior prom, and later had sex with Stan in a Chevy at a drive-in movie. One of their dates, allegedly at Coney Island, resulted in Dorothy becoming pregnant.[15] The show says this conception happened while Dorothy was drunk, which Sophia blames on Stan's actions and peer pressure.

When Stan proposed to Dorothy, he took her to an expensive restaurant and while she was in the powder room, he ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon champagne and put an engagement ring in Dorothy's glass.

character,Character: Dorothy Zbornak,"In her show Elaine Stritch at Liberty, British actress Elaine Stritch claimed to have been considered for the role at one point but that she ""blew her audition"" by improvising colorful language and so was not cast as Dorothy. Stritch fit the ""Bea Arthur type"" description and had actually played a version of Arthur's character Maude in Nobody's Perfect, a British adaptation of Maude broadcast in 1980 by ITV. Following Stritch's auditions, others read for the role, but news of the series eventually made its way to Arthur herself: ""This is so funny. My agent called me and said, 'What is this? I hear you're doing a new series... Something called Golden Girls.'""
Bea Arthur and her agent investigated and discovered that several women had auditioned for a role described as ""a Bea Arthur type"" and it had led to a rumor that she was herself involved. At the time Arthur had taken a position as the spokeswoman for Shoppers Drug Mart, a Canadian drugstore chain (a role she would continue concurrently with her role as Dorothy). Arthur then requested to see the script, but still hesitated to join the cast after learning that the other two leads -- the sexually forward Blanche and the sheltered and sometimes naive Rose were to be respectively portrayed by Rue McClanahan, who had co-starred with her as Vivian Harmon on Maude, and Betty White, known for playing flirtatious, sexually liberated Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show.

It was really give-and-take between the writers and actors... I was blessed that we had wonderful people.""[38] Arthur considered Dorothy to be ""the great leveler"" and the ""great balloon pricker,"" someone who openly defied and called out hypocrisy, injustice, cruelty, delusion, short-sighted remarks, and behavior she simply found dull, ill-considered, rude, or unreasonable.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Dorothy_Zbornak

character,Character: Blanche Devereaux,"Blanche is a highly-promiscuous, overly-confident, and sexually liberated woman, frequently on the prowl in almost desperate search for a man who would be her new love. Most of her free time consists of being out and about with a new man outside of the home or outside of her job at the museum. She was often observed as blatantly flirtatious and seductive with almost every man she came across with her little Southern Belle ways. Her go-to color palette for her fashionable sense of style and attire was a lot of red, as red is the color palette associated with attractiveness. Blanche spends a good deal of her free time outside of work and home with members of the opposite sex, much to the disgust and sometimes amusement of her housemates --  in sharp contrast to the overall climate of the 1980s, when the reality of AIDS was beginning to sink into the American public. In the episode ""72 Hours"", it is revealed that Blanche is fully cognizant of the dangers of AIDS and HIV, and always uses protection and knows as much of every lover's sexual history as she can.[3] Much of Blanche's promiscuous nature stems from the death of her one true love, George Devereaux. The two were high school sweethearts, and when George passed away, Blanche became disillusioned with love and was consumed by impulsive behavior.

character,Character: Blanche Devereaux,"Over the course of the series, Blanche has had a veritable arsenal of both sexual and romantic partners, all varying in background and disposition. Some of them have been less than savory, such as Blanche's first in-series beau Harry, whom she was set to marry after two weeks of dating, turning out to be a bigamist wanted in four states.[4] Another prospective partner stole Blanche's necklace during her Full Moon-Leap Year's Party, though he was later caught and arrested. Another man, Gary, cheated on Blanche in her own home with Rose's visiting sister Holly.[5] Perhaps the worst of Blanche's partners was Rex Huntington, who was emotionally and verbally abusive towards her and later tried to physically harm Dorothy when confronted about his behavior.[6]",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Blanche_Devereaux
character,Character: Blanche Devereaux,"But though she is often mocked for a perceived lack of standards, Blanche does indeed have standards for her relationships. She refuses to even unknowingly engage in infidelity and steps back when her beau wishes to reconnect with his former wife or girlfriend. The most notable example of this is shown in ""Stand By Your Man"", where Blanche overcame her apprehension towards dating a wheelchair-bound man named Ted, only to end their relationship upon finding out that he was already married.[7] ""Yes, We Have No Havanas"" seems to imply that Blanche is willing to at the very least attempt a polyamorous relationship, as she continued seeing Fidel Santiago when he wanted to date both her and Sophia. However, this relationship quickly drove a wedge between the women, but the rivalry came to an abrupt end when Fidel suddenly died. As it turned out, Fidel was even more promiscuous than Blanche -- and the congregation at his funeral consisted entirely of women he had been romancing, with exception for Dorothy and Rose.[8]",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Blanche_Devereaux
character,Character: Blanche Devereaux,"Similarly to Rue McClanahan's personal life, Blanche also self-sabotaged herself and hurt her own image in front of her best friends. When oftentimes when Blanche denies a sexual encounter occurring, she isn't believed as her promiscuous nature leads people to assume she didn't want to admit she slept with someone. In ""The Triangle"", Elliot Clayton makes a pass at Blanche despite him already seeing Dorothy, and Blanche tells Dorothy what happened after being prompted by Rose. However, Dorothy doesn't believe Blanche due to her already having expressed an attraction to Elliot; and furthermore, Elliot lies about the encounter when confronted. Blanche is so upset that she kicks Dorothy out of the house, but Dorothy eventually learns the truth and apologizes to Blanche, mending their friendship.[9] In addition, Gil Kessler, a town's councilman, is accused of having an affair with Blanche after she helps him with a speech all night. Despite Blanche's seemingly calming innocence, Gil tells everyone the rumors were true. Shocked to hear this come out from his mouth, Blanche confronts Gil in private to admit that he lied in order to gain votes in the reelection. Seeing how much he embarrassed and hurt Blanche in front of people she did not know, he confesses the truth in a live speech.[10] This self-sabotaging behavior also transfers over to her love life, as she has also ruined good relationships with worthy men. Jake Smollens was very in love with Blanche and even proposed to her, but Blanche turned him down due to her disgust for his perceived lack of social graces.[11] She also turned down Richard, an extremely wealthy and doting partner, because she didn't want to be a mother for his two young children.[12] When her beau Steven was hospitalized, Blanche didn't visit him because she was worried about the relationship getting too serious -- and when she finally got up the courage to visit him, Steven had reconciled with his ex-wife.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Blanche_Devereaux

When Rose and Dorothy are shocked to learn that Blanche had never been with a married man, she replied ""Well, I'm no fool. The husband's always so guilty, he ends up giving the really expensive gifts to the wife!""[13] In contrast to the promiscuous Blanche remaining staunchly faithful to her husband, George had an affair with another woman that resulted in a son, implying that despite all the seemingly perky happiness George and Blanche had, the marriage was very much flawed.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Blanche_Devereaux
character,Character: Blanche Devereaux,"Once of Blanche's most prominent gags was her strict vagueness about how old she was, from not divulging her age, to telling lies of omission about her age, and perhaps most egregiously, destroying any information related to how old she is. As featured in ""Snap Out Of It"", Rose took Blanche's legal documentation without her knowing, and after digging through these files, found that Blanche's age was deleted by authority of the governor. It is assumed that Blanche met with the governor and bribed him to get rid of all of her birthdates.[14] Though it is widely believed by fans that Blanche's age was never truly divulged, ""Mother's Day"" reveals that Blanche was seventeen in 1949. It's implied that Blanche's mother not only taught her to hide her age, but encouraged her to do it, as Elizabeth herself casually mentions that she is eighty-five. When Blanche reminds her mother that she's eighty-nine, Elizabeth coyly reveals the most important lesson she taught Blanche -- no true lady ever tells her age.[15]",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Blanche_Devereaux

In The Golden Palace episode “Camp Town Races Aren't Nearly as Much Fun as They Used to Be”, she hung up a Confederate battle flag and was unaware of the offense it caused to black people, including hotel manager Roland, who viewed it as a symbol of racism, while Blanche saw it as a symbol of heritage and happy memories of growing up in the South.",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Blanche_Devereaux

This led to Blanche having a number of misconceptions and misunderstandings about certain topics -- for example, she became terrified of getting her period because her mother would only refer to it as ""the curse"", and she was irrationally terrified of a witch coming to curse her when she turned thirteen. Though Blanche had gotten her period, she was elated to discover that she hadn't been cursed, and explained this to both her mother and her doctor.

She expresses regrets that she was not there for her children more, and it is loosely implied that she might have been emotionally abusive to them when they were growing up.

Blanche and her sisters had a very hostile relationship, with Blanche insisting that both sisters made the other two miserable their entire lives. While Charmaine would constantly feign fictitious ailments to get out of doing chores, Virginia was actively hostile towards Blanche and tried to steal whatever she could from her; from poodle skirts to Blanche's boyfriends. Once, Virginia broke the star for the Christmas tree and told Blanche to stick her finger in it.

When Blanche was fifteen, her mother took her to the doctor because Blanche claimed she still hadn't gotten ""the curse"".

In Maude, Rue played Maude's best friend and next-door neighbor, the ditzy yet loyal Vivian Cavender-Harmon. Furthermore, Rue and Betty co-starred as the secondary main characters in the first two seasons of Mama's Family; Rue played the role of an uptight, sarcastic, sharp-tongued Aunt Frances Crowley, while Betty played the role of a snobbish, wealthy, and assertive Mary Ellen Harper-Jackson.[33]",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Blanche_Devereaux

""For example, Blanche's walk came to me very quickly after 'The Pilot'. That's not my natural walk. But, it's hers. And, I don't think there's anyone else on earth who walks like Blanche. Movement is very important to me in developing a role; and I think Blanche's walk showed self-assurance and her always being on top of the situation. If she was at The Rusty Anchor or on a date, she felt it was irresistible and beguiling. The shoes were a big part of it. The sound they made.

An innocent, loving, and kind-hearted simpleton, Rose rented a room in Blanche Devereaux's Miami home after being kicked out of her old apartment for keeping a pet.

character,Character: Rose Nylund,"Rose is an innocent, naïve, and exceptionally kind-hearted woman. She was best known for her rambling of somewhat nonsensical stories of her bizarre hometown village of St. Olaf, Minnesota, which her housemates often endured with exasperated silence, disbelief, and the occasional muttering of insults.  Rose is something a bit of a pushover, who rarely stands up for herself. On one occasion, her blind sister, Lily, tried to convince Rose into moving to Chicago to take care of her. At Dorothy's many urgings to Rose to reconsider, Rose said no to Lily, which forced Lily to learn how to care for herself. Without Dorothy being the voice of reason, Rose would have said yes and been the pushover being that Rose is simply so kind-hearted. Although all four women volunteered their time, Rose was arguably the most involved in charity work. She drove a bookmobile, was a candy striper at a hospital, and helped organize a charity talent show, as well as among other things. She was a perennial runner up for a Volunteer of the Year award, even coming in second to a woman who was already dead.[1] She also has a tendency to become scared and paranoid easily, with the most prominent example being shown in ""Break-In"", when she developed CPTSD from a break-in at the house.[2]",https://goldengirls.fandom.com/wiki/Rose_Nylund
